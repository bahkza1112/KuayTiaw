# Changelog

All notable changes to Tower Quest 🏰 will be documented in this file.

## v1.6.4 — Tower Popup Clarity + Screen Transitions

### Changed
- **Tower popup (HUD clarity)**: now shows an effective **DPS** stat
  (damage × fire rate) for towers with both, and the damage stat displays
  an inline `(+X% synergy)` badge when an active synergy is boosting
  damage. (`js/tower.js`, `showTowerPopup`)
- **Screen transitions**: all `showScreen()` calls (stage select, gameplay,
  codex, dev panel, leaderboard, etc.) now fade/slide in via a
  `.screen-enter` CSS animation instead of an instant cut. End-of-stage/
  pause overlays (`.obox`) now pop in with a quick scale-fade.
  (`css/main.css`, `js/ui.js`)

### Notes
- No save-format or balance changes. Verified in-browser: tower popup shows
  correct DPS/synergy values (e.g. Magic tower with Ice synergy: 53 dmg
  "+20% synergy", DPS 42.4), codex screen fades in via `.screen-enter`, no
  console errors.

## v1.6.3 — Mobile Layout Fix

### Changed
- **Mobile layout (≤540px)**: gameplay screen (`#gp`) is now top-aligned
  instead of vertically centered, consolidating unused vertical space into
  a single block below the game UI instead of splitting it into bars above
  and below. (`css/main.css`, `@media (max-width:540px)`)

### Notes
- Canvas itself remains width-constrained (375×312.5 at 375px viewport) due
  to its 1.2:1 internal aspect ratio vs. portrait phone screens — full fix
  would require changing canvas internal resolution/grid (out of scope, see
  `docs/Roadmap.md`).
- Verified in-browser at 375×812: HUD, canvas, tower panel, dev panel, and
  codex all render correctly with no console errors.

## v1.6.2 — Tower/Monster Balance Tuning + Design Docs

### Changed
- **Cannon (💣)**: base damage 28 → 24 (DPS/Cost 0.672 → 0.576). Splash
  remains its differentiator without also leading raw single-target
  efficiency. (`js/game.js`, `DEFAULT_CFG.t_dmg`)
- **Magic (✨)**: base damage 38 → 44 (DPS/Cost 0.405 → 0.469). Now the
  clear premium AoE pick given its larger splash radius. (`js/game.js`,
  `DEFAULT_CFG.t_dmg`)
- **หมอผี Shaman (🧙)**: gold reward 18 → 12 (reward/HP 0.257 → 0.171),
  bringing it in line with other monsters (~0.13–0.15) while still
  rewarding priority kills. (`js/game.js`, `DEFAULT_CFG.m_rew`)

### Added
- New `docs/` folder with design references: `GDD.md`, `TowerDesign.md`,
  `EnemyDesign.md`, `BalanceSheet.md`, `Roadmap.md`. `BalanceSheet.md` is
  the canonical numeric reference for tower/enemy stats and must be kept
  in sync with `DEFAULT_CFG` changes.
- `CLAUDE.md` and `PROJECT_MASTER.md` now link to `docs/`.

### Notes
- No save-format or architecture changes. Verified in-browser: updated
  `CFG.t_dmg`/`CFG.m_rew` values load correctly with no console errors.

## v1.6.1 — CSS/JS Modularization

Structural-only refactor: split the monolithic `Tower Quest 🏰 v1.6.0.html`
into a shared stylesheet and five JS modules. No gameplay, save format, or
behavior changes — verified byte-for-byte that the new files reconstruct the
original `<style>`/`<script>` content exactly.

### Changed
- Extracted the inline `<style>` block into `css/main.css`, referenced via
  `<link rel="stylesheet">`.
- Extracted the inline `<script>` block into five files, loaded in order
  (load order is required — see PROJECT_MASTER.md → Architecture Overview):
  - `js/save.js` — persistence & achievements
  - `js/enemy.js` — enemy data, spawning, sprites
  - `js/tower.js` — tower data, synergies, sprites, 3D overlay, popup/upgrades
  - `js/game.js` — stages/config, game loop, weather, sound, endgame mode
  - `js/ui.js` — screens, cutscenes, codex, dev panel, leaderboard, button wiring
- `Tower Quest 🏰 v1.6.0.html` now contains only HTML head/body markup and
  the `<link>`/`<script src>` references (~430 lines, down from ~5,900).

### Notes
- `localStorage` keys (`tq_*`) and all gameplay logic are unchanged.

## v1.6.0 — Initial Project Snapshot

This entry marks the baseline snapshot of the project at the start of
documentation/refactor planning. v1.6.0 (`Tower Quest 🏰 v1.6.0.html`) is the
current development base.

### Snapshot Highlights
- 10-stage story campaign (Grassland → Dark Tower Summit) with per-stage
  paths, story cutscenes, and unlockable towers.
- 8 tower types (Cannon, Ice, Magic, Sniper, Support, Archer, Gold Mine,
  Thunder) with independent damage/range/rate upgrade paths, path-exclusive
  perks (e.g. pierce shield, rapid fire), runes, and an "Awaken" end-tier
  upgrade with 3D visual effects.
- 11 monster types (including flying enemies, shielded enemies, healer
  Shaman, and the Demon Lord final boss) with stage/wave-based scaling.
- Tower synergy system providing cross-type bonuses.
- Weather system affecting gameplay (fog, blizzard, lightning strikes,
  etc.) per stage.
- Endgame survival mode with 3 difficulties and a local leaderboard.
- Achievement system across story, combat, skill, endgame, and collection
  categories.
- In-game Codex (monster/tower encyclopedia) and Dev Panel (balance tuning,
  cheats, debug tools).
- Procedural canvas-based 2D art for towers/enemies plus an optional
  Three.js 3D tower-rendering overlay.
- All progress/save data persisted via `localStorage` (`tq_*` keys); no
  backend or build tooling.

### Documentation Added
- Added `CLAUDE.md` (assistant working guidelines).
- Added `PROJECT_MASTER.md` (full system reference: core, tower, enemy,
  save, UI, progression, and architecture overviews).
- Added scaffolding folders `css/`, `js/`, `assets/images/`,
  `assets/sounds/`, `assets/effects/` in preparation for a future refactor
  (no game code moved yet — pending approval).
